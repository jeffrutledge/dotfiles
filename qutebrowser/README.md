I tired qutebrowser again for the last couple weeks. I am switching back to chomium. It is less performant to a degree that is problematic:
1. tabs/windows take a >5secs to open compared to almost instance chromium
2. I think chomium is doing better at saving resources on idle tabs
3. youtube player lags and tears
